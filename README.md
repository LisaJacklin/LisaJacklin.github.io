### INTENDED USE
the intended use for this .io is to use it as a learning tool for me to be able to 
post and express my progress on certain tasks that I've put myself out to learn.

I hope that this may someday be a reference to myself and potentially to those who are looking to 
see what I have experience in doing and maybe help push myself into the DevOps universe.

## TODO
- [] Setup a basic homepage 
- [] determine the sub pages and information I'd like to display

- [] add in any fun coloring or schemes that I can do
